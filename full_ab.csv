"Recent years have seen a dramatic expansion of tasks and datasets posed as question answering, from reading comprehension, semantic role labeling, and even machine translation, to image and video understanding. With this expansion, there are many differing views on the utility and definition of ""question answering"" itself. Some argue that its scope should be narrow, or broad, or that it is overused in datasets today. In this opinion piece, we argue that question answering should be considered a format which is sometimes useful for studying particular phenomena, not a phenomenon or task in itself. We discuss when a task is correctly described as question answering, and when a task is usefully posed as question answering, instead of using some other format."
"Given a certain complexity level, humanized agents may select from a wide range of possible tasks, with each activity corresponding to a transient goal. In general there will be no overarching credit assignment scheme allowing to compare available options with respect to expected utilities. For this situation we propose a task selection framework that is based on time allocation via emotional stationarity (TAES). Emotions are argued to correspond to abstract criteria, such as satisfaction, challenge and boredom, along which activities that have been carried out can be evaluated. The resulting timeline of experienced emotions is then compared with the `character' of the agent, which is defined in terms of a preferred distribution of emotional states. The long-term goal of the agent, to align experience with character, is achieved by optimizing the frequency for selecting the individual tasks. Upon optimization, the statistics of emotion experience becomes stationary."
"Online 1 on 1 class is created for more personalized learning experience. It demands a large number of teaching resources, which are scarce in China. To alleviate this problem, we build a platform (marketplace), i.e., \emph{Dahai} to allow college students from top Chinese universities to register as part-time instructors for the online 1 on 1 classes. To warn the unqualified instructors and ensure the overall education quality, we build a monitoring and alerting system by utilizing multimodal information from the online environment. Our system mainly consists of two key components: banned word detector and class quality predictor. The system performance is demonstrated both offline and online. By conducting experimental evaluation of real-world online courses, we are able to achieve 74.3\% alerting accuracy in our production environment."
"To better understand the impacts of similarities and dissimilarities in human and AV personalities we conducted an experimental study with 443 individuals. Generally, similarities in human and AV personalities led to a higher perception of AV safety only when both were high in specific personality traits. Dissimilarities in human and AV personalities also yielded a higher perception of AV safety, but only when the AV was higher than the human in a particular personality trait."
"We present GQSAT, a branching heuristic in a Boolean SAT solver trained with value-based reinforcement learning (RL) using Graph Neural Networks for function approximation. Solvers using GQSAT are complete SAT solvers that either provide a satisfying assignment or a proof of unsatisfiability, which is required for many SAT applications. The branching heuristic commonly used in SAT solvers today suffers from bad decisions during their warm-up period, whereas GQSAT has been trained to examine the structure of the particular problem instance to make better decisions at the beginning of the search. Training GQSAT is data efficient and does not require elaborate dataset preparation or feature engineering to train. We train GQSAT on small SAT problems using RL interfacing with an existing SAT solver. We show that GQSAT is able to reduce the number of iterations required to solve SAT problems by 2-3X, and it generalizes to unsatisfiable SAT instances, as well as to problems with 5X more variables than it was trained on. We also show that, to a lesser extent, it generalizes to SAT problems from different domains by evaluating it on graph coloring. Our experiments show that augmenting SAT solvers with agents trained with RL and graph neural networks can improve performance on the SAT search problem."
"We consider the problem of controlling a large fleet of drones to deliver packages simultaneously across broad urban areas. To conserve their limited flight range, drones can seamlessly hop between and ride on top of public transit vehicles (e.g., buses and trams). We design a novel comprehensive algorithmic framework that strives to minimize the maximum time to complete any delivery. We address the multifaceted complexity of the problem through a two-layer approach. First, the upper layer assigns drones to package delivery sequences with a provably near-optimal polynomial-time task allocation algorithm. Then, the lower layer executes the allocation by periodically routing the fleet over the transit network while employing efficient bounded-suboptimal multi-agent pathfinding techniques tailored to our setting. We present extensive experiments supporting the efficiency of our approach on settings with up to $200$ drones, $5000$ packages, and large transit networks of up to $8000$ stops in San Francisco and the Washington DC area. Our results show that the framework can compute solutions within a few seconds (up to $2$ minutes for the largest settings) on commodity hardware, and that drones travel up to $450 \%$ of their flight range by using public transit."
"We design and conduct a simple experiment to study whether neural networks can perform several steps of approximate reasoning in a fixed dimensional latent space. The set of rewrites (i.e. transformations) that can be successfully performed on a statement represents essential semantic features of the statement. We can compress this information by embedding the formula in a vector space, such that the vector associated with a statement can be used to predict whether a statement can be rewritten by other theorems. Predicting the embedding of a formula generated by some rewrite rule is naturally viewed as approximate reasoning in the latent space. In order to measure the effectiveness of this reasoning, we perform approximate deduction sequences in the latent space and use the resulting embedding to inform the semantic features of the corresponding formal statement (which is obtained by performing the corresponding rewrite sequence using real formulas). Our experiments show that graph neural networks can make non-trivial predictions about the rewrite-success of statements, even when they propagate predicted latent representations for several steps. Since our corpus of mathematical formulas includes a wide variety of mathematical disciplines, this experiment is a strong indicator for the feasibility of deduction in latent space in general."
"Over the last three decades more then sixty meta-heuristic algorithms have been proposed by the various authors. Such algorithms are inspired from physical phenomena, animal behavior or evolutionary concepts. These algorithms have been widely used for solving the various real world optimization problems. Researchers are continuously working to improve the existing algorithms and also proposing new algorithms that are giving competitive results as compared to the existing algorithms present in the literature. In this paper a novel meta heuristic algorithm based on military dogs squad is introduced. The proposed algorithm mimics the searching capability of the trained military dogs. Military dogs have strong smell senses by which they are able to search the suspicious objects like bombs, wildlife scats, currency, or blood as well as they can communicate with each other by their barking. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on 17 benchmark functions and compared with five other meta-heuristics namely particle swarm optimization (PSO), multiverse optimizer (MVO), genetic algorithm (GA), probability based learning (PBIL) and evolutionary strategy (ES). The results are validated in terms of mean and standard deviation of the fitness value. The convergence behavior and consistency of the results have been also validated by plotting convergence graphs and BoxPlots. Further the, proposed algorithm is successfully utilized to solve the real world fake review detection problem. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other considered algorithms on the majority of performance parameters."
"The combined electric and acoustic stimulation (EAS) has demonstrated better speech recognition than conventional cochlear implant (CI) and yielded satisfactory performance under quiet conditions. However, when noise signals are involved, both the electric signal and the acoustic signal may be distorted, thereby resulting in poor recognition performance. To suppress noise effects, speech enhancement (SE) is a necessary unit in EAS devices. Recently, a time-domain speech enhancement algorithm based on the fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) with a short-time objective intelligibility (STOI)-based objective function (termed FCN(S) in short) has received increasing attention due to its simple structure and effectiveness of restoring clean speech signals from noisy counterparts. With evidence showing the benefits of FCN(S) for normal speech, this study sets out to assess its ability to improve the intelligibility of EAS simulated speech. Objective evaluations and listening tests were conducted to examine the performance of FCN(S) in improving the speech intelligibility of normal and vocoded speech in noisy environments. The experimental results show that, compared with the traditional minimum-mean square-error SE method and the deep denoising autoencoder SE method, FCN(S) can obtain better gain in the speech intelligibility for normal as well as vocoded speech. This study, being the first to evaluate deep learning SE approaches for EAS, confirms that FCN(S) is an effective SE approach that may potentially be integrated into an EAS processor to benefit users in noisy environments."
"Increasing model size when pretraining natural language representations often results in improved performance on downstream tasks. However, at some point further model increases become harder due to GPU/TPU memory limitations, longer training times, and unexpected model degradation. To address these problems, we present two parameter-reduction techniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training speed of BERT. Comprehensive empirical evidence shows that our proposed methods lead to models that scale much better compared to the original BERT. We also use a self-supervised loss that focuses on modeling inter-sentence coherence, and show it consistently helps downstream tasks with multi-sentence inputs. As a result, our best model establishes new state-of-the-art results on the GLUE, RACE, and SQuAD benchmarks while having fewer parameters compared to BERT-large."
"We study open domain response generation with limited message-response pairs. The problem exists in real-world applications but is less explored by the existing work. Since the paired data now is no longer enough to train a neural generation model, we consider leveraging the large scale of unpaired data that are much easier to obtain, and propose response generation with both paired and unpaired data. The generation model is defined by an encoder-decoder architecture with templates as prior, where the templates are estimated from the unpaired data as a neural hidden semi-markov model. By this means, response generation learned from the small paired data can be aided by the semantic and syntactic knowledge in the large unpaired data. To balance the effect of the prior and the input message to response generation, we propose learning the whole generation model with an adversarial approach. Empirical studies on question response generation and sentiment response generation indicate that when only a few pairs are available, our model can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art response generation models in terms of both automatic and human evaluation."
"Automatic news comment generation is beneficial for real applications but has not attracted enough attention from the research community. In this paper, we propose a ""read-attend-comment"" procedure for news comment generation and formalize the procedure with a reading network and a generation network. The reading network comprehends a news article and distills some important points from it, then the generation network creates a comment by attending to the extracted discrete points and the news title. We optimize the model in an end-to-end manner by maximizing a variational lower bound of the true objective using the back-propagation algorithm. Experimental results on two public datasets indicate that our model can significantly outperform existing methods in terms of both automatic evaluation and human judgment."
"We present a spoken conversational question answering proof of concept that is able to answer questions about general knowledge from Wikidata. The dialogue component does not only orchestrate various components but also solve coreferences and ellipsis."
"Co-operative learning in heterogeneous teams refers to learning methods in which teams are organised both to accomplish academic tasks and for individuals to gain knowledge. Competencies, personality and the gender of team members are key factors that influence team performance. Here, we introduce a team composition problem, the so-called synergistic team composition problem (STCP), which incorporates such key factors when arranging teams. Thus, the goal of the STCP is to partition a set of individuals into a set of synergistic teams: teams that are diverse in personality and gender and whose members cover all required competencies to complete a task. Furthermore, the STCP requires that all teams are balanced in that they are expected to exhibit similar performances when completing the task. We propose two efficient algorithms to solve the STCP. Our first algorithm is based on a linear programming formulation and is appropriate to solve small instances of the problem. Our second algorithm is an anytime heuristic that is effective for large instances of the STCP. Finally, we thoroughly study the computational properties of both algorithms in an educational context when grouping students in a classroom into teams using actual-world data."
"Valuation-Based~System can represent knowledge in different domains including probability theory, Dempster-Shafer theory and possibility theory. More recent studies show that the framework of VBS is also appropriate for representing and solving Bayesian decision problems and optimization problems.   In this paper after introducing the valuation based system (VBS) framework, we present Markov-like properties of VBS and a method for resolving queries to VBS."
"Graph convolutional neural networks have demonstrated promising performance in attributed graph learning, thanks to the use of graph convolution that effectively combines graph structures and node features for learning node representations. However, one intrinsic limitation of the commonly adopted 1-D graph convolution is that it only exploits graph connectivity for feature smoothing, which may lead to inferior performance on sparse and noisy real-world attributed networks. To address this problem, we propose to explore relational information among node attributes to complement node relations for representation learning. In particular, we propose to use 2-D graph convolution to jointly model the two kinds of relations and develop a computationally efficient dimensionwise separable 2-D graph convolution (DSGC). Theoretically, we show that DSGC can reduce intra-class variance of node features on both the node dimension and the attribute dimension to facilitate learning. Empirically, we demonstrate that by incorporating attribute relations, DSGC achieves significant performance gain over state-of-the-art methods on node classification and clustering on several real-world attributed networks."
"The AIBC is an Artificial Intelligence and blockchain technology based large-scale decentralized ecosystem that allows system-wide low-cost sharing of computing and storage resources. The AIBC consists of four layers: a fundamental layer, a resource layer, an application layer, and an ecosystem layer. The AIBC implements a two-consensus scheme to enforce upper-layer economic policies and achieve fundamental layer performance and robustness: the DPoEV incentive consensus on the application and resource layers, and the DABFT distributed consensus on the fundamental layer. The DABFT uses deep learning techniques to predict and select the most suitable BFT algorithm in order to achieve the best balance of performance, robustness, and security. The DPoEV uses the knowledge map algorithm to accurately assess the economic value of digital assets."
"We present ""AutoJudge"", an automated evaluation method for conversational dialogue systems. The method works by first generating dialogues based on self-talk, i.e. dialogue systems talking to itself. Then, it uses human ratings on these dialogues to train an automated judgement model. Our experiments show that AutoJudge correlates well with the human ratings and can be used to automatically evaluate dialogue systems, even in deployed systems. In a second part, we attempt to apply AutoJudge to improve existing systems. This works well for re-ranking a set of candidate utterances. However, our experiments show that AutoJudge cannot be applied as reward for reinforcement learning, although the metric can distinguish good from bad dialogues. We discuss potential reasons, but state here already that this is still an open question for further research."
"In recent years, machine learning (ML) has become a key enabling technology for the sciences and industry. Especially through improvements in methodology, the availability of large databases and increased computational power, today's ML algorithms are able to achieve excellent performance (at times even exceeding the human level) on an increasing number of complex tasks. Deep learning models are at the forefront of this development. However, due to their nested non-linear structure, these powerful models have been generally considered ""black boxes"", not providing any information about what exactly makes them arrive at their predictions. Since in many applications, e.g., in the medical domain, such lack of transparency may be not acceptable, the development of methods for visualizing, explaining and interpreting deep learning models has recently attracted increasing attention. This introductory paper presents recent developments and applications in this field and makes a plea for a wider use of explainable learning algorithms in practice."
"In this paper, we introduce Symplectic ODE-Net (SymODEN), a deep learning framework which can infer the dynamics of a physical system from observed state trajectories. To achieve better generalization with fewer training samples, SymODEN incorporates appropriate inductive bias by designing the associated computation graph in a physics-informed manner. In particular, we enforce Hamiltonian dynamics with control to learn the underlying dynamics in a transparent way which can then be leveraged to draw insight about relevant physical aspects of the system, such as mass and potential energy. In addition, we propose a parametrization which can enforce this Hamiltonian formalism even when the generalized coordinate data is embedded in a high-dimensional space or we can only access velocity data instead of generalized momentum. This framework, by offering interpretable, physically-consistent models for physical systems, opens up new possibilities for synthesizing model-based control strategies."
"Ellipsis and co-reference are common and ubiquitous especially in multi-turn dialogues. In this paper, we treat the resolution of ellipsis and co-reference in dialogue as a problem of generating omitted or referred expressions from the dialogue context. We therefore propose a unified end-to-end Generative Ellipsis and CO-reference Resolution model (GECOR) in the context of dialogue. The model can generate a new pragmatically complete user utterance by alternating the generation and copy mode for each user utterance. A multi-task learning framework is further proposed to integrate the GECOR into an end-to-end task-oriented dialogue. In order to train both the GECOR and the multi-task learning framework, we manually construct a new dataset on the basis of the public dataset CamRest676 with both ellipsis and co-reference annotation. On this dataset, intrinsic evaluations on the resolution of ellipsis and co-reference show that the GECOR model significantly outperforms the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) baseline model in terms of EM, BLEU and F1 while extrinsic evaluations on the downstream dialogue task demonstrate that our multi-task learning framework with GECOR achieves a higher success rate of task completion than TSCP, a state-of-the-art end-to-end task-oriented dialogue model."
"In the presence of non-admissible heuristics, A* and other best-first algorithms can be converted into anytime optimal algorithms over OR graphs, by simply continuing the search after the first solution is found. The same trick, however, does not work for best-first algorithms over AND/OR graphs, that must be able to expand leaf nodes of the explicit graph that are not necessarily part of the best partial solution. Anytime optimal variants of AO* must thus address an exploration-exploitation tradeoff: they cannot just ""exploit"", they must keep exploring as well. In this work, we develop one such variant of AO* and apply it to finite-horizon MDPs. This Anytime AO* algorithm eventually delivers an optimal policy while using non-admissible random heuristics that can be sampled, as when the heuristic is the cost of a base policy that can be sampled with rollouts. We then test Anytime AO* for action selection over large infinite-horizon MDPs that cannot be solved with existing off-line heuristic search and dynamic programming algorithms, and compare it with UCT."
"The two-stage strategy has been widely used in image classification. However, these methods barely take the classification criteria of the first stage into consideration in the second prediction stage. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage representation method (TSR), and convert it to a Single-Teacher Single-Student (STSS) problem in our two-stage image classification framework. We seek the nearest neighbours of the test sample to choose candidate target classes. Meanwhile, the first stage classifier is formulated as the teacher, which holds the classification scores. The samples of the candidate classes are utilized to learn a student classifier based on L2-minimization in the second stage. The student will be supervised by the teacher classifier, which approves the student only if it obtains a higher score. In actuality, the proposed framework generates a stronger classifier by staging two weaker classifiers in a novel way. The experiments conducted on several face and object databases show that our proposed framework is effective and outperforms multiple popular classification methods."
"While neural networks have acted as a strong unifying force in the design of modern AI systems, the neural network architectures themselves remain highly heterogeneous due to the variety of tasks to be solved. In this chapter, we explore how to adapt the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) technique used for explaining the predictions of feed-forward networks to the LSTM architecture used for sequential data modeling and forecasting. The special accumulators and gated interactions present in the LSTM require both a new propagation scheme and an extension of the underlying theoretical framework to deliver faithful explanations."
"The penalized least squares (PLS) is a classic approach to inverse problems, where a regularization term is added to stabilize the solution. Optimal transport (OT) is another mathematical framework for computer vision tasks by providing means to transport one measure to another at a minimal cost. Cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (cycleGAN) is a recent extension of GAN to learn target distributions with less mode collapsing behaviour. Although similar in that no supervised training is required, the algorithms look different, so the mathematical relationship between these approaches is not clear. In this article, we provide an important advance to unveil the missing link. Specifically, we reveal that a cycleGAN architecture can be derived as a dual formulation of the optimal transport problem, if the PLS with a deep learning penalty is used as a transport cost between the two probability measures from measurements and unknown images. This suggests that cycleGAN can be considered as a stochastic generalization of classical PLS approaches. Our derivation is so general that various types of cycleGAN architecture can be easily derived by merely changing the transport cost. As proofs of concept, this paper provides novel cycleGAN architecture for unsupervised learning in accelerated MRI and deconvolution microscopy problems, which confirm the efficacy and the flexibility of the theory."
"We study the characterization and computation of general policies for families of problems that share a structure characterized by a common reduction into a single abstract problem. Policies $\mu$ that solve the abstract problem P have been shown to solve all problems Q that reduce to P provided that $\mu$ terminates in Q. In this work, we shed light on why this termination condition is needed and how it can be removed. The key observation is that the abstract problem P captures the common structure among the concrete problems Q that is local (Markovian) but misses common structure that is global. We show how such global structure can be captured by means of trajectory constraints that in many cases can be expressed as LTL formulas, thus reducing generalized planning to LTL synthesis. Moreover, for a broad class of problems that involve integer variables that can be increased or decreased, trajectory constraints can be compiled away, reducing generalized planning to fully observable non-deterministic planning."
"Potential heuristics for state-space search are defined as weighted sums over simple state features. Atomic features consider the value of a single state variable in a factored state representation, while binary features consider joint assignments to two state variables. Previous work showed that the set of all admissible and consistent potential heuristics using atomic features can be characterized by a compact set of linear constraints. We generalize this result to binary features and prove a hardness result for features of higher dimension. Furthermore, we prove a tractability result based on the treewidth of a new graphical structure we call the context-dependency graph. Finally, we study the relationship of potential heuristics to transition cost partitioning. Experimental results show that binary potential heuristics are significantly more informative than the previously considered atomic ones."
"Under the headline ""AI safety"", a wide-reaching issue is being discussed, whether in the future some ""superhuman artificial intelligence"" / ""superintelligence"" could could pose a threat to humanity. In addition, the late Steven Hawking warned that the rise of robots may be disastrous for mankind. A major concern is that even benevolent superhuman artificial intelligence (AI) may become seriously harmful if its given goals are not exactly aligned with ours, or if we cannot specify precisely its objective function. Metaphorically, this is compared to king Midas in Greek mythology, who expressed the wish that everything he touched should turn to gold, but obviously this wish was not specified precisely enough. In our view, this sounds like requirements problems and the challenge of their precise formulation. (To our best knowledge, this has not been pointed out yet.) As usual in requirements engineering (RE), ambiguity or incompleteness may cause problems. In addition, the overall issue calls for a major RE endeavor, figuring out the wishes and the needs with regard to a superintelligence, which will in our opinion most likely be a very complex software-intensive system based on AI. This may even entail theoretically defining an extended requirements problem."
"We present a control approach for autonomous vehicles based on deep reinforcement learning. A neural network agent is trained to map its estimated state to acceleration and steering commands given the objective of reaching a specific target state while considering detected obstacles. Learning is performed using state-of-the-art proximal policy optimization in combination with a simulated environment. Training from scratch takes five to nine hours. The resulting agent is evaluated within simulation and subsequently applied to control a full-size research vehicle. For this, the autonomous exploration of a parking lot is considered, including turning maneuvers and obstacle avoidance. Altogether, this work is among the first examples to successfully apply deep reinforcement learning to a real vehicle."
"We present a framework for data-driven robotics that makes use of a large dataset of recorded robot experience and scales to several tasks using learned reward functions. We show how to apply this framework to accomplish three different object manipulation tasks on a real robot platform. Given demonstrations of a task together with task-agnostic recorded experience, we use a special form of human annotation as supervision to learn a reward function, which enables us to deal with real-world tasks where the reward signal cannot be acquired directly. Learned rewards are used in combination with a large dataset of experience from different tasks to learn a robot policy offline using batch RL. We show that using our approach it is possible to train agents to perform a variety of challenging manipulation tasks including stacking rigid objects and handling cloth."
"In this paper, we propose a novel implicit semantic data augmentation (ISDA) approach to complement traditional augmentation techniques like flipping, translation or rotation. Our work is motivated by the intriguing property that deep networks are surprisingly good at linearizing features, such that certain directions in the deep feature space correspond to meaningful semantic transformations, e.g., adding sunglasses or changing backgrounds. As a consequence, translating training samples along many semantic directions in the feature space can effectively augment the dataset to improve generalization. To implement this idea effectively and efficiently, we first perform an online estimate of the covariance matrix of deep features for each class, which captures the intra-class semantic variations. Then random vectors are drawn from a zero-mean normal distribution with the estimated covariance to augment the training data in that class. Importantly, instead of augmenting the samples explicitly, we can directly minimize an upper bound of the expected cross-entropy (CE) loss on the augmented training set, leading to a highly efficient algorithm. In fact, we show that the proposed ISDA amounts to minimizing a novel robust CE loss, which adds negligible extra computational cost to a normal training procedure. Although being simple, ISDA consistently improves the generalization performance of popular deep models (ResNets and DenseNets) on a variety of datasets, e.g., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. Code for reproducing our results are available at https://github.com/blackfeather-wang/ISDA-for-Deep-Networks."
"We tackle the human motion imitation, appearance transfer, and novel view synthesis within a unified framework, which means that the model once being trained can be used to handle all these tasks. The existing task-specific methods mainly use 2D keypoints (pose) to estimate the human body structure. However, they only expresses the position information with no abilities to characterize the personalized shape of the individual person and model the limbs rotations. In this paper, we propose to use a 3D body mesh recovery module to disentangle the pose and shape, which can not only model the joint location and rotation but also characterize the personalized body shape. To preserve the source information, such as texture, style, color, and face identity, we propose a Liquid Warping GAN with Liquid Warping Block (LWB) that propagates the source information in both image and feature spaces, and synthesizes an image with respect to the reference. Specifically, the source features are extracted by a denoising convolutional auto-encoder for characterizing the source identity well. Furthermore, our proposed method is able to support a more flexible warping from multiple sources. In addition, we build a new dataset, namely Impersonator (iPER) dataset, for the evaluation of human motion imitation, appearance transfer, and novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in several aspects, such as robustness in occlusion case and preserving face identity, shape consistency and clothes details. All codes and datasets are available on https://svip-lab.github.io/project/impersonator.html"
"In this paper, we present a keyphrase generation approach using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). In our GAN model, the generator outputs a sequence of keyphrases based on the title and abstract of a scientific article. The discriminator learns to distinguish between machine-generated and human-curated keyphrases. We evaluate this approach on standard benchmark datasets. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in generation of abstractive keyphrases and is also comparable to the best performing extractive techniques. We also demonstrate that our method generates more diverse keyphrases and make our implementation publicly available."
"Some of the most successful applications of deep reinforcement learning to challenging domains in discrete and continuous control have used policy gradient methods in the on-policy setting. However, policy gradients can suffer from large variance that may limit performance, and in practice require carefully tuned entropy regularization to prevent policy collapse. As an alternative to policy gradient algorithms, we introduce V-MPO, an on-policy adaptation of Maximum a Posteriori Policy Optimization (MPO) that performs policy iteration based on a learned state-value function. We show that V-MPO surpasses previously reported scores for both the Atari-57 and DMLab-30 benchmark suites in the multi-task setting, and does so reliably without importance weighting, entropy regularization, or population-based tuning of hyperparameters. On individual DMLab and Atari levels, the proposed algorithm can achieve scores that are substantially higher than has previously been reported. V-MPO is also applicable to problems with high-dimensional, continuous action spaces, which we demonstrate in the context of learning to control simulated humanoids with 22 degrees of freedom from full state observations and 56 degrees of freedom from pixel observations, as well as example OpenAI Gym tasks where V-MPO achieves substantially higher asymptotic scores than previously reported."
"Recognizing subtle historical patterns is central to modeling and forecasting problems in time series analysis. Here we introduce and develop a new approach to quantify deviations in the underlying hidden generators of observed data streams, resulting in a new efficiently computable universal metric for time series. The proposed metric is in the sense that we can compare and contrast data streams regardless of where and how they are generated and without any feature engineering step. The approach proposed in this paper is conceptually distinct from our previous work on data smashing, and vastly improves discrimination performance and computing speed. The core idea here is the generalization of the notion of KL divergence often used to compare probability distributions to a notion of divergence in time series. We call this the sequence likelihood (SL) divergence, which may be used to measure deviations within a well-defined class of discrete-valued stochastic processes. We devise efficient estimators of SL divergence from finite sample paths and subsequently formulate a universal metric useful for computing distance between time series produced by hidden stochastic generators."
"We present a challenging new benchmark and learning-environment for robot learning: RLBench. The benchmark features 100 completely unique, hand-designed tasks ranging in difficulty, from simple target reaching and door opening, to longer multi-stage tasks, such as opening an oven and placing a tray in it. We provide an array of both proprioceptive observations and visual observations, which include rgb, depth, and segmentation masks from an over-the-shoulder stereo camera and an eye-in-hand monocular camera. Uniquely, each task comes with an infinite supply of demos through the use of motion planners operating on a series of waypoints given during task creation time; enabling an exciting flurry of demonstration-based learning. RLBench has been designed with scalability in mind; new tasks, along with their motion-planned demos, can be easily created and then verified by a series of tools, allowing users to submit their own tasks to the RLBench task repository. This large-scale benchmark aims to accelerate progress in a number of vision-guided manipulation research areas, including: reinforcement learning, imitation learning, multi-task learning, geometric computer vision, and in particular, few-shot learning. With the benchmark's breadth of tasks and demonstrations, we propose the first large-scale few-shot challenge in robotics. We hope that the scale and diversity of RLBench offers unparalleled research opportunities in the robot learning community and beyond."
"While progress has been made in understanding the robustness of machine learning classifiers to test-time adversaries (evasion attacks), fundamental questions remain unresolved. In this paper, we use optimal transport to characterize the minimum possible loss in an adversarial classification scenario. In this setting, an adversary receives a random labeled example from one of two classes, perturbs the example subject to a neighborhood constraint, and presents the modified example to the classifier. We define an appropriate cost function such that the minimum transportation cost between the distributions of the two classes determines the minimum $0-1$ loss for any classifier. When the classifier comes from a restricted hypothesis class, the optimal transportation cost provides a lower bound. We apply our framework to the case of Gaussian data with norm-bounded adversaries and explicitly show matching bounds for the classification and transport problems as well as the optimality of linear classifiers. We also characterize the sample complexity of learning in this setting, deriving and extending previously known results as a special case. Finally, we use our framework to study the gap between the optimal classification performance possible and that currently achieved by state-of-the-art robustly trained neural networks for datasets of interest, namely, MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10."
"Purpose: To identify optimal classification methods for computed tomography (CT) radiomics-based preoperative prediction of clear cells renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) grade. Methods and material: Seventy one ccRCC patients were included in the study. Three image preprocessing techniques (Laplacian of Gaussian, wavelet filter, and discretization of the intensity values) were applied on tumor volumes. In total, 2530 radiomics features (tumor shape and size, intensity statistics, and texture) were extracted from each segmented tumor volume. Univariate analysis was performed to assess the association of each feature with the histological condition. In the case of multivariate analysis, the following was implemented: three feature selection including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), students t-test and minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) algorithms. These selected features were then used to construct three classification models (SVM, random forest, and logistic regression) to discriminate the high from low-grade ccRCC at nephrectomy. Lastly, multivariate model performance was evaluated on the bootstrapped validation cohort using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Univariate analysis demonstrated that among different image sets, 128 bin discretized images have statistically significant different (q-value < 0.05) texture parameters with a mean of AUC 0.74 (q-value < 0.05). The three ML-based classifier shows proficient discrimination of the high from low-grade ccRCC. The AUC was 0.78 in logistic regression, 0.62 in random forest, and 0.83 in SVM model, respectively. Conclusion: Radiomics features can be a useful and promising non-invasive method for preoperative evaluation of ccRCC Fuhrman grades. Key words: RCC, Radiomics, Machine Learning, Computed Tomography"
"Auto-regressive sequence-to-sequence models with attention mechanism have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many tasks such as machine translation and speech synthesis. These models can be difficult to train. The standard approach, teacher forcing, guides a model with reference output history during training. The problem is that the model is unlikely to recover from its mistakes during inference, where the reference output is replaced by generated output. Several approaches deal with this problem, largely by guiding the model with generated output history. To make training stable, these approaches often require a heuristic schedule or an auxiliary classifier. This paper introduces attention forcing, which guides the model with generated output history and reference attention. This approach can train the model to recover from its mistakes, in a stable fashion, without the need for a schedule or a classifier. In addition, it allows the model to generate output sequences aligned with the references, which can be important for cascaded systems like many speech synthesis systems. Experiments on speech synthesis show that attention forcing yields significant performance gain. Experiments on machine translation show that for tasks where various re-orderings of the output are valid, guiding the model with generated output history is challenging, while guiding the model with reference attention is beneficial."
